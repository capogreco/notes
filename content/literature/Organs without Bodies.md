### The Reality of the Virtual

> what matters to Deleuze is not virtual reality, but the reality of the virtual (which, in Lacanian terms, is the Real.)

^ deserves further explanation

> The genius of Deleuze resides in his notion of "transcendental empiricism": in contrast to the standard notion of the transcendental as the formal conceptual network which structures the rich flow of empirical data, the Deleuzian "transcendental" is infinitely RICHER than reality - it is the infinite potential field of virtualities out of which reality is actualized.

standard transcendantal == Wittgenstein's "the world"?
	ie. all that is the case, 
	ie. Brandomian network of inferential relations

comparison with [[Objective Idealism]], and [[Speculative Realism]]?

> ... should NOT be interpreted as an "allegory" with a fixed "deeper meaning," but as a pure "mechanic" intensity beyond meaning ...

>That is to say, we totally misread _Nashville_ if we locate the songs within the global horizon of the ironico-critical depiction of the vacuity and ritualized commercial alienation of the universe of American country music: on the contrary, we are allowed - even seduced into - fully enjoying the music on its own, in its affective intensity, independently of Altman's obvious critico-ideological project. (And, incidentally, the same goes for the songs from Brecht's great pieces: their musical pleasure is independent of their ideological message.)

a clue! .. to what [[music]] *is*

> one is tempted to read the Altmanian "despair and anxiety" as the deceiving obverse of the more affirmative immersion into the multitude of subliminal intensities.

subliminal intensities here may refer to the inferential relations of the ritual one is *not* invited to make explicit?
